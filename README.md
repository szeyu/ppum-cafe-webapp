### Food Tracker Statuses:
1. **Queued** - Item waiting to be prepared
2. **Preparing** - Currently being cooked
3. **Ready** - Ready for pickup
4. **Collected** - Customer has collected

### Order Status Progression:
- **"Accepted"** - Order placed, all items queued
- **"Preparing"** - Some items being prepared
- **"Partially Ready"** - Some items ready, others still preparing

- **Consistency Checks** to prevent status mismatches

### Status Update Logic:
```
Food Tracker Status → Order Status
All Queued → "Accepted"
Some Preparing → "Preparing"
Some Ready + Some Preparing → "Partially Ready"
All Ready → "Ready for Pickup"
All Collected → "Completed"
```

### Recent Improvements:
- ✅ **Fixed Order Status Consistency** - Orders now properly update when food items are collected
- ✅ **Enhanced Status Transitions** - Smooth progression from Preparing → Ready → Collected
